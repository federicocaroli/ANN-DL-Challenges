# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Challenges - PoliMi

This repository contains the solutions and code for challenges completed as part of the **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning** course at the **Polytechnic University of Milan**.

## üìö Overview
The goal of these challenges, completed between **September and December 2023**, was to design and implement deep learning models to solve a variety of tasks, including **binary classification of plant health** based on image datasets and **forecasting future samples in uncorrelated time series**. The challenges emphasized building effective models, optimizing their performance, and analyzing errors to gain insights.

### Challenge 1: Binary Classification of Plant Health
The solutions include:

- **Preprocessing datasets**: Removing outliers, duplicates, and handling imbalances.
- **Model implementation**: ResNet, ConvNeXtBase, EfficientNet, and other state-of-the-art architectures.
- **Optimization techniques**: Transfer learning, fine-tuning, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Performance evaluation**: Ensemble methods and error analysis.

### Challenge 2: Time Series Forecasting
In this challenge, the task was to predict future samples of uncorrelated time series based on past observations. The solutions include:

- **Data preprocessing**: Removing padding, handling variable time series lengths, and categorizing datasets.
- **Model implementation**: Bidirectional LSTM networks with masking layers for sequence-to-vector predictions.
- **Feature engineering**: Building and expanding sequences using custom algorithms.
- **Performance evaluation**: Validation through Mean Squared Error (MSE) and ensemble methods for improved generalization.
