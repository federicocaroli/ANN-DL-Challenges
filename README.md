# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Challenges - PoliMi

This repository contains the solutions and code for challenges completed as part of the **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning** course at the **Polytechnic University of Milan**.

## üìö Overview
The challenges, completed between **September and December 2023**, primarily focus on designing, training, and evaluating deep learning models to solve real-world problems, such as binary classification tasks.

The solution of the first challenge includes:
- **Preprocessing datasets**: Removing outliers, duplicates, and handling imbalances.
- **Model implementation**: ResNet, ConvNeXtBase, EfficientNet, and other state-of-the-art architectures.
- **Optimization techniques**: Transfer learning, fine-tuning, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Performance evaluation**: Ensemble methods and error analysis.
